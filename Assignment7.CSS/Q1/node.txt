(1) Describe the main difference between the CSS Flexbox layout model and the CSS Grid layout model. when would you choose to use one over the other? 

Flexbox vs Grid :------

Flexbox:-
Works in one direction at a time (either horizontal or vertical).
Ideal for layouts where items are in a single row or column, like a navbar or a row of buttons.
Use Flexbox when you need to distribute space between items in one direction.

Grid:-
Works in two directions (both horizontal and vertical).
Ideal for more complex layouts where you need to control both rows and columns, like a full webpage layout with sections.
Use Grid when you need to manage a large layout with multiple rows and columns.
